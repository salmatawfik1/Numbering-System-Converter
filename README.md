The Number System Converter project is designed to convert numbers between different numbering systems, such as binary, octal, decimal, hexadecimal, and all other bases.
The project is implemented as a MIPS assembly program that can efficiently translate numbers from one system to another, providing the ability for users to input a number and its system, then enter the desired output system.
It was done as a part of computer architecture course.
Conversion is mainly done by using the following two assembly functions:
      a. OtherToDecimal: receives two parameters (the number and the system to which it belongs).
      b. DecimalToOther: receives a decimal number, and the system to which it should be converted.
