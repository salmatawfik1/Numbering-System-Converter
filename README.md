The Number System Converter project is designed to convert numbers between different numbering systems, such as binary, octal, decimal, hexadecimal, and all other bases.
The project is implemented as a MIPS assembly program that can efficiently translate numbers from one system to another, providing the ability for users to input a number and its system, then enter the desired output system.
It was done as a part of computer architecture course.
